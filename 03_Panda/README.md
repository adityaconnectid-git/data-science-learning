# Pandas for Data Science

This folder contains my structured **Pandas practice** focused on real-world data analysis workflows used in Data Science.

Pandas is a powerful library built on NumPy and is widely used for:

- Data cleaning  
- Data manipulation  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Preparing datasets for Machine Learning  

---

## 📌 Topics Covered

### 🟦 Data Loading
- Reading CSV files (`read_csv`)
- Reading Excel files (`read_excel`)
- Reading JSON files (`read_json`)
- Understanding encoding issues (`utf-8`, `latin1`)
- Saving DataFrames (`to_csv`, `to_excel`, `to_json`)

---

### 🟦 Data Exploration
- Viewing first and last rows (`head`, `tail`)
- Dataset summary (`info`)
- Descriptive statistics (`describe`)
- Understanding:
  - `shape`
  - `columns`
  - data types

---

### 🟦 Data Selection
- Selecting single column (Series)
- Selecting multiple columns (DataFrame subset)
- Row filtering using conditions
- Multiple conditions using `&` and `|`
- Boolean filtering

---

### 🟦 Practical Data Handling
- Creating DataFrames manually
- Working with numeric and categorical data
- Basic dataset inspection before analysis

---

## 📂 Folder Structure

- Step-by-step practice scripts  
- Concept-based examples  
- Clean, readable, beginner-to-intermediate level code  

---

## 🎯 Learning Objective

The goal of this section is to:

- Understand how real datasets are structured  
- Learn how to inspect and filter data properly  
- Build confidence before moving to:
  - Missing value handling
  - GroupBy operations
  - Data aggregation
  - Visualization
  - Machine Learning preprocessing
