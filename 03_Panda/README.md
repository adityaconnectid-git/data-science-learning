# Pandas for Data Science

This folder contains my structured **Pandas practice and applied data analysis workflows** as part of my Data Science journey.

Pandas is one of the most important libraries in Data Science, used for:

- Data cleaning
- Data transformation
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering
- Preparing datasets for Machine Learning models

---

## 📌 Topics Covered

### 🟦 Data Loading & Saving
- Reading CSV, Excel, and JSON files
- Handling encoding issues (`utf-8`, `latin1`)
- Exporting datasets (`to_csv`, `to_excel`, `to_json`)

---

### 🟦 Data Exploration & Inspection
- `head()`, `tail()`
- `info()`, `describe()`
- `shape`, `columns`, `dtypes`
- Duplicate detection
- Missing value detection

---

### 🟦 Data Selection & Filtering
- Column selection (Series & DataFrame)
- Boolean filtering
- Multiple conditions (`&`, `|`)
- Sorting values
- Conditional filtering

---

### 🟦 Data Cleaning & Transformation
- Handling missing values (`dropna`, `fillna`, interpolation)
- Removing duplicates
- Renaming columns
- Creating new columns
- Updating values using `loc`
- Type conversion using `astype`
- Applying custom logic (`apply`, `map`)
- Working with categorical data

---

### 🟦 Data Aggregation & Analysis
- `groupby()` operations
- Aggregations (`sum`, `mean`, etc.)
- `value_counts()`
- `pivot_table()` for summary analysis

---

### 🟦 Combining Data
- `merge()` (inner, left, right, outer, cross)
- `join()`
- `concat()` (vertical & horizontal stacking)

---
