# Python Fundamentals for Data Science

This folder contains my structured Python practice focused on building a strong foundation for Data Science and Machine Learning.

The goal of this section is to master core Python concepts required for data analysis, problem solving, and real-world projects.

## Topics Covered
- Day 01: Python Basics (variables, data types)
- Day 02: Strings
- Day 03: Lists and Tuples
- Day 04: Dictionaries and Sets
- Day 05: Conditional Expressions (if, elif, else)
- Day 06: Loops (for, while)
- Day 07: Functions and Recursion
- Day 08: File Input and Output

## Folder Structure
Each day is organized into a separate folder containing:
- Practice code (`.py` files)
- Concept-focused examples

## Status
Currently learning and improving Python fundamentals with hands-on practice.
