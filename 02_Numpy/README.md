# NumPy for Data Science

This folder contains my NumPy practice focused on numerical computing for Data Science.

NumPy is used as the core library for efficient array operations, mathematical computations, and as a foundation for Pandas and Machine Learning.

## 📌 Topics Covered

### 🟦 NumPy Basics
- Creating arrays using Python lists
- Arrays with default values (`zeros`, `ones`)
- Custom value arrays using `full`
- Sequence generation using `arange`
- Identity matrices using `eye`

### 🟦 Array Properties
- shape
- dtype
- dimensional understanding (1D vs 2D)
